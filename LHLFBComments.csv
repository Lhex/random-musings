1,620,"Dear Sir, as outsiders, it is unfair for any of us to judge your family matters and I felt very sad as a Singaporean that your siblings had chosen such a way to put the interest of stability of Singapore aside to make such allegations arising out of a family dispute. Singapore is in good hands of good leadership and a very capable team, I am still very proud and assured to have you as our PM. It is very easy for anyone to just complain and leave the country while it is the toughest for one who stay behind and guard the interest of the country under the eyes of the citizens. Please take care and have a good break.",2.3,0.3,2017-06-14T02:19:32+0000
2,618,LKY has passed on 2 years ago. His last will should have been settled by now. Seeing as how your siblings only put out a message now goes to show that things have really gone out of hand. They had no other choice but to put out such a condemning statement.   Preserving your father's home will not aid your legacy. Only the job you have done would mean anything. Singapore is a meritocratic democracy. Not a monarchy. Another Lee who deserves the job just because he is LKY's grandson is not in line with LKY's legacy of meritocracy. Therefore respect the old man's wishes and demolish the house with immediate effect.,3.3,0,2017-06-14T02:56:21+0000

Yes, Mr Hsien Yang and Ms Wei Ling wants the home to be demolished in respect to Mr LKY's wishes, but as PM, things are never that clear cut.   Family First or Nation First?

6,798,"[In fact, despite the numerous attacks by Lee Wei Ling in the past years against her brother, I can?t help but noticed that never once PM Lee retaliated in kind, especially in public. In fact, isn?t the preservation of a family home the very act of keeping a family together? And who stabs someone in the back at 3am under the cover of darkness while he is overseas holidaying anyways? One might wonder if such actions are in fact a departure from Lee Kuan Yew?s values.]  Lee Hsien Loong is a brother as well as the Prime Minister. He's first and foremost an Elected MP and PM, his responsibility is to uphold the law of the land. His hand might be tied by the Preservation of Monuments Act which LKY enacted in 1971.

The government's view to preserve the house as a legacy for future generations is not wrong but going against the wishes of our late LKY will make it tough. Instead a good solution would be do use VR to map the house in 3D. Technology is there now to let users immerse themself and feel that they are walking in the house through VR.

I have upmost respect and unconditional love for Late Lee Kuan Yew and he would be very sad and disappointed to see from up there that his family is tearing apart. He has been a father of the nation and has been working very hard to build Singapore from the start. If he can do it, I'm sure being the eldest son you can continue his legacy and find a solution with all your siblings to overcome family issues. I don't deny all family have their issues but the person who takes the step forward in resolving this is the great one. I have upmost respect and love for you PM Lee.

We are beginning deteriorating back into a third world country with all the screw ups. The situation u are facing now can't be worse den how u are helping in transforming sg to a third world.

36,258,It's all mainly about the house. In my opinion it's a personal family matter which should have been settled privately. Not good for Singapore's reputation to air these personal family affairs publicly. Singapore would be viewed negatively on the world stage.,1.4,0,2017-06-14T01:55:47+0000

While I feel for the insistence of HY and WL to honour MM Lee?s death wish? I also felt sad that a piece of history will be lost to future generations. I?m sure that you may have many counsels to advise on the matter on preserving the artefact or to lose it.  Not sure if any of the counsels proposed this to you before but here is my proposal. Let peace be found in your family? allow the physical building be demolished but build a scaled model of the resident and place it on the property.  Keep significant pieces of furniture / structure with historical values on-site for preservation.  (I believe the garden? the whole piece of property will be make public for education and preservation) I believe, we have the technology to capture the entire house (may be with its occupants) before it is demolished so that we?ll be able to provide a virtual tour of the property.  We have done this for your National Museum. At least the future generation will still have the physical garden and its surrounding and not losing all.  With the digital archive of the building, I believe we can do much to preserve this part of history and present it (in many ways) to the future generations. Let peace prevail and family ties be strengthened.  God bless.",4.7,0.2,2017-06-14T04:11:20+0000

40,766,"Dear PM, 1 thing our founding PM aka your late father did which stopped all complains from all areas is to completely cut off the roots of potential issues.  For instance, when the government from the 1960s to 1980s needed land in Bishan cemetries, there are many Chinese clans associations making huge noise.... but your late father did the unexpected by clearing up your own Hakka-clan cemetries at Ghim Moh area to pave up more lands for housing and setting up an example.... from there on, all Chinese dialects clans kept quiet and give way to clearing up cemetries to pave up more land for housing.....  Same for this case, time to consider demolishing 38 Oxley Road sooner to prevent more unthinkable nightmares on this issue.  Just my 2-cent worth of opinion.",1.8,-0.2,2017-06-14T03:35:07+0000

We are multi racial/religion, so we don't have the luxury of most country to unite us together through these conventional means. We have very short history, and Singaporeans do not have the idea to regard heritage, culture and the arts in high regard. This house in my opinion, is not private property. It's a heritage shared by all Singaporeans. Now many people thinks that it's just a house, let us respect the old man's wishes and demolish it, period. But we would also be demolishing an important part of history, not other people's history but OUR history. From heritage's perspective we need to preserve this house.   I think the best course of action now is to remain status quo, and let us mull over the subj. Once the house is demolished, it cannot be rebuilt (can be done but no point, it's not the original). Let us all mull over the subj. I understand as sons and daughter it is an emotional issue for you, at the same time pls think from the perspective of a Singapore citizen.

Mr Lee Kuan Yew would not have relinquished all official positions and stepped down as MM in 2011 if he had no confidence in you to lead Singapore as the third PM. Singapore was his sole preoccupation since he became PM in 1959. It is sad for me and I believe for many right-thinking Singaporeans to read what your siblings have written on their face books.

I cherish and am very grateful for the peaceful and good life that Singaporeans have enjoyed in the last 52 years of nation building.

Whether we liked his methods or not, he brought us to where we are.   It was his personal wish that no monuments or tangible evidence of his private life be preserved. But, when he chose to adopt his role in government, he became a public figure.  He became part of Singapore. And Singapore belongs to us.  Enough of our past has been obliterated in the name of progress. How many of us still recognize the places we spent our childhood?  How we, the people of Singapore, chose to remember Lee Kuan Yew is our right. It is no longer the wish of one man, or his children.  Even Mao Zedong could not escape the consequences of greatness.

356,1946,"Honorable Prime Minister, like many Singaporeans, I am saddened to have read the Sibling Dispute headlines.  No doubt, many Singaporeans echo similar views on keeping family disputes behind closed door.  The late Minister Mentor, Lee Kuan Yew was fiercely loved and respected by millions back home and on international soil.   Not because he was the nation's founding father but because of his principles and core values.   Forgive me for my bluntness, perhaps our much loved Prime Minister's siblings have forgotten their father's core values.  What I am struggling to comprehend is the childish feud over the demolishing of the late Minister Mentor's family  property and your strong influence over your son to join politics.  While the former may be seen an being disrespectful to the wishes of the late Minister Mentor, the latter is your son.  Being the father, you have every right to influence your son to consider politics.  Mind you, you are not the first Prime Minister and father to have done that either.   On the other hand, your siblings have disrespected their late father on all levels by going public.  Prime Minister, may I gently remind you that you have taken an Oath, witnessed by millions to protect Singapore's integrity and to continue practising the core values and principles of our late nation founding father.   You have 5,779,080 Singaporeans including expats and international businesses who are relying on you to run the country.   If that means a permanent farewell to your siblings, then so be it.   Trust me when I say this, your siblings will not be missed by fellow Singaporeans.   Personally I was not even aware of their existence nor their blood ties with you family.

412,2533,"Pray for Singapore... The Lee?s Altercations: A Sad, Sad Day of My Life By Dr John Ng, Eagles Founding member.  June 14 is one of the saddest days of  my life! Reading the 6-page statement by Lee Hsien Yang and Dr. Lee Wei Ling, for losing their trust in their brother and his leadership, my well-respected Prime Minister, Lee Hsien Loong and his subsequent face book reply has made me very sad.   Why am I so sad?  1.	The fight involves the affairs of one of the world?s and my personal hero: the late Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew. I have always had the highest regard for his children. But their unashamed and unmitigated fight has jolted my senses and numbed my feelings. 2.	The fight is over a piece of property and concerns the dying wish of a father.  3.	The fight is between a supposedly-close knitted siblings, with no hold-bars accusations and attacks. Any parents will feel very sad if their children fought so viciously. I will be the saddest parent if my children behaved that way. I am certain that the late Mr. and Mrs. Lee Kuan Yew would feel the same way too if they were alive. 4.	The fight centers around three brilliant leaders and siblings, who should know better. What a tragic tale! 5.	The fight has divided the nation and the citizens. The social media and market talks are all a buzz over this heartbreaking story. 6.	The fight has affected negatively the reputation of a well-governed Singapore. Our Prime Miinister has always been held as a role-model of great governance but now he has been tainted.  It reminds me that he is human after all. 7.	The fight is more terrifying than the external threat of terrorism. Internal divides are even more devastating than external menaces. 8.	The fight has again eroded my trust in our government, which our leaders fought so hard to build over the years and now has been corroded by this ongoing feud in these two days. 9.	The fight has affected their spouses and their children, who are set on accusing each other of inappropriate behaviours. 10.	Finally, the fight has escalated from personal differences to sibling conflicts to family disputes to national divide and to international disrepute.  I am now in Jakarta and my Indonesian friends are shocked by the news. They have always spoken highly of Singapore.  Truly, I am very, very sad.   I hope and pray that all disputed parties can settle the issues amicably, overcome their  pains, recover from the hurts and learn to forgive.

510,2966,"I do agree that such differences should be kept within the family.  As much as the LKY legacy both sides have been claiming to be upholding, I do think it is pretty subjective, and I am sure LKY would not stand on either side fully as well, and will feel heartbroken by all of these internal issues.  In the case of the Oxley House, I do believe that besides the part on ""Hero Worship"" , there might have been other concerns by LKY himself that led to him wanting the dismantling on the house.   He himself might have felt the need to eliminate any chance of any form of ""Hero Worship"" after his passing, and also give it as a chance to demonstrate the impartiality of his children on carrying out his wills and follow his footsteps on the integrity and rules to follow, and it is the father's heart to allow his children to use this to showcase the impartiality in their decisions, and ruling. To me financially it is not a concern for LKY vs the gains from fufilling his will and showing his children impartiality. Emotionally, it is something you guys have to deal with after demolition. In my view, as much memories it might hold, it is wiser to demolish as according to his will.   However, for any case on the issue of ""Hero Worshiping"" which the other family members claim to be happening, I would beg to differ in some ways.  As much as one can dislike any form of credit to themselves or after their passing, it cannot not deny the human nature of respect and adoration they have of someone that might be truly one of the most fundamental founding father. In this case, it is a vague area between adoration, respect, gratitude from fellow Singaporeans, and in extreme cases ""hero worship"". Afterall Singapore has a relative short history for Singaporeans to relate to and feel the sense of belonging   It is not wrong that the government or HL have taken to ride on the waves of such gratefulness from fellow Singaporeans after His Passing amidst an increasingly chaotic international environment and rising nationalism globally, to stabilize the hearts of Singaporeans, for their own sake. To me this will not be ""Hero-Worshipping"" and if LKY was still around, he might not totally disagree with this way of making sure Singapore is still on a stable path of growth, financially and emotionally, even if it had contradicted his initial ideas on no ""hero worshiping:  Lastly looking at the memoirs from his grandsons that talked about how receptive their grandfather was and how he will not step into politics once he was out of the field. We can tell sometimes he understands change is inevitable, and he cant always be relevant to the recent times as much as his trusted successors. We will kind of agree that he will stay on this side, no matter what strong stand he had on certain issues, as long as it is the best for the future of Singapore.

604,1999,"Someone texted this to me....  Dear Lee Siblings  Singapore woke up to the  public fight between all 3+++ of you. Now dsyfunctional families are common. So are fights between siblings. These are usually amplified after the last parent passes away. Most of us keep it in within families; occasionally when it involves money, it ends up in court. Now, family fights are usually none of anybody's business except the family members involve - and it's usually complicated and complex and there are sides which relatives take, and outsiders don't because it's none of our business.  Except now you've made it every Singaporean's business by taking it public and airing your grievances in such a manner. This is now no longer a private matter, not just a Lee Family matter; it's not even a public spectacular - more importantly it has now become a Singapore and Singaporean matter.   Singapore does not belong to the Lees. Even though Singapore was Lee Kuan Yew's love and his legacy, and Singapore is defined by him, it still does not make Singapore his or his family's.  By dragging this into the public arena in such a manner, you are dragging Singaporeans not just into it by taking sides, but you are dragging Singapore down at time when we can ill-afford it. China, terrorism, state of the economy, leadership problems - Singapore is facing numerous issues which needs urgent attention. We cannot afford to lose investors confidence or a stock market crash.  So fight if you must, it's your family's prerogative - but you are now dragging Singaporeans into it, plus dragging Singapore's reputation and Lee Kuan Yew, our past Prime Minister; not just your father; into this whole public fracas.   It will affect Singapore - not just your family. While concerns in the letter are possibly valid, this public avenue does not benefit anyone and will affect Singapore most.

627,3309,"What you are doing is the right thing. Regardless of the late Mr Lee's wish, it cannot take precedence over national needs: in this case to preserve the house for posterity as it's an important part of Singapore history. We're just a nation of 50, and if we don't make every effort to preserve it, then we're a people who will soon suffer from what one historian referred to as "" collective amnesia"". I understand your siblings ' anxiety to honour their dad's wish; by the same token I understand your wish to do that and to act responsibly as the Head of the government! Not an envious position to be in! Anyone who chides you is myopic, misinformed and lacks the capacity to understand the dilemma you are in.  Regardless, we've all been taught that it has to be ""Nation before Self; otherwise the years of National Service we put our boys through will ring hollow!  Hsien Yang's judgement has been clouded by his love for his dad, his need to support his sister, and I suspect, his aspirations for his son to someday rise to the highest-ranking office in the land. In such a situation, it's difficult to expect him to think clearly.  That is why you are the PM, the leader.  Heavy is the head that wears the crown! It's not anyone who can be the leader; no doubt, every one aspires to be one. Despite the noise and the rumblings, he has to think clearly, dismiss the noise, and weigh the options, and DO WHAT IS RIGHT! It may not be the popular choice,  but it certainly has to be the right one! Lee Kuan Yew always took up the responsibility to make the right decision,  especially in the face of difficult choices. Then he set out to explain the rationale behind the decision. You are his first born; you inherited that mantle and the heavy responsibility. Nobody will understand the responsibility of the eldest child, and in Asian society, the eldest son, except those who are in a similar position!   You are strong!  I've seen that in you and have come to respect that. I have no doubt that you will not vacillate , and that Lee Kuan Yew himself would make the same decision,  if he had to!  You will too! Deng Xiao Ping said  "" if a man has to be 100% sure before he can do something, he will never be able to do anything! "" That's why we need leaders; they are a special breed who listen,  consider, then decide and move on! They also have the courage and the integrity to make course corrections when the evidence shows overwhelmingly that the alternative is better!  In the case of 38 Oxley Road, if you preserve it now,  and then are confronted by overwhelming evidence that it should indeed be demolished, you can do it still.  If however, you demolish it now, bowing to peer as well as sibling pressure , and then have to contend with evidence that it was not the right decision, would you be able to raise it from its rubble?  So,  leaders are calculating and decisive, but they are also pragmatic enough to give themselves a way back!  I believe you know all these ; I'm just helping you to wade through some of the deafening noise! I do not envy you, Mr Prime Minister! My best wishes are with you.

It will be a great remembrance for the world and make those who love him proud.  Then I google to read LKY's Will on this matter at mothership.sg  I am sad and so torn at it and have to sadly agree that perhaps since LKY has even wanted to make this a will for the public means he really wanted his house to be demolished.  How I wished there were more people to convince LKY when he was alived to keep his house after his demised, to assure him that his big heartedness deserve his house to be kept.   Pls understand that LKY did this cuz he is soooo considerate not to clog up space for our land and high maintenance of old building. I respect LKY even more now?. In a way, all the more his house should be preserved actually. E.g. if I fetch someone home and the person insists to be dropped off at the main road which require walking a distant to the block, out of Only the reason of being considerate for the driver, then all the more I won't bother the person's wish and will drive the person right up to the unit door step if possible?. Cuz I will feel such a person deserves it.   I am quite sure if there was months of enough assurance, pleaing and sweet talks from many many others to LKY that he is not an ordinary man & many in the world will like his house to be around and to grant this favor for history sake and for all who love him. We are not worshipping LKY but for the reason that there are not many men of the billions stand out like that. If the world can make space to build museums including wax museum of celebrities, what more LKY. E.g. Michael Jackson is a legacy of his own too.   But then LKY has strictly wanted his house not to be opened to the public in the event his house is not demolished, then it's actually right to respect his wish and will ?.  I hope all our respected Lee's family will come to a compromise for their father's sake cuz this matter only tarnish LKY's reputation.  I pray for love among one another.

He served the nation with his life, why does he have to sacrifice his last will and been unhappy because of his service?   How will we feel if we serve the nation and made clearly of your personal will and yet the nation chose to go against it?   Not to say, his home is his own property not Singapore national gallery.

1181,502,So basically Lee Kuan Yew did not care about his family after he died. He basically just wanted to demolish the house without thinking about what this might do to his family (breakup/squabbles etc.). Isn't it a bit selfish? How did the situation end up being a quarrel over a house? If Lee Kuan Yew had foresight would he have predicted this? Did he want his children to fight over this? What idiosyncrasies led him to think that he could demolish the house and that not lead to the family breaking up?,1.9,-0.2,2017-06-14T15:49:18+0000

LHL has to carry out the wishes of other voice of citizen in his capacity as PM.

1669,606,It is very painful for any parents to see siblings at each other?s throat.  Perhaps a careful demolition/dissemble of the house in to 5 sections and transported to the Istana for reassembly would be ideal. This can be done by specialist historic building movers. Lee Kwan Yew did not specify how the rubble should be managed. The reassembled house could be used as guest housing for foreign dignitaries in the Istana. 38 Oxley be made into a park as Lee Kwan Yew loves trees. Some of the hundreds of trees he personally planted could be replanted there. In loving memory of the Garden city he helped build.,3.6,0.1,2017-06-15T03:14:07+0000
